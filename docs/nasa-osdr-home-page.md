[**Open Science:** ](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/about/opensci.html)The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) enables access to space-related data from experiments and missions that investigate biological and health responses of terrestrial life to spaceflight. The goal of OSDR is to enable multi-modal and multi-hierarchical fundamental space life science data, including 'omics, phenotypic, physiological, behavioral, hardware, and environmental data, to be reused toward basic science, applied science, and operational outcomes for space exploration and knowledge discovery.

[**ALSDA**:](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/about/alsda.html) The [Ames Life Science Data Archive ](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/about/alsda.html) (ALSDA) provides public access to a wide range of data from space-relevant experiments and missions, including physiological, phenotypic, bioimaging, video, behavioral, hardware, and environmental telemetry data. The goal of ALSDA is to enable the reuse of this fundamental space life science data towards basic science, applied science, and operational outcomes for space exploration and knowledge discovery. ALSDA has recently been integrated into the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR), which also includes the NASA GeneLab and the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection, in order to improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) of its data.

To the right of the text is the website&#x27;s navigation menu the &#x22;Research and Resources,&#x22; option has been selected revealing subpages “Publications”, “AI/ML”, “AI4LS”, “Seminar”, “HBISS”, “Open Science”, “Data Management Policies for BPS” and “TOPS”."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

[**Publications:**](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/data/publications.html)[ ](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/data/publications.html)This page contains links to literature related to the Open Science Repository, a central hub for NASA's open science publications. It includes journal articles, reports, and other scientific documents that have been made publicly available.

**AI/ML:** The "AI/ML" drop-down menu offers a link to the "AI4LS" (Artificial Intelligence for Life in Space Working Group) page. This working group brings together experts from NASA, academia, and industry to explore the potential of AI and machine learning for advancing life in space.

[**AI4LS:**](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/data/ai4ls.html) The AI4LS working group focuses on utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods to analyze complex, heterogeneous, multi-modal biological datasets. ML approaches have shown promise for deriving meaningful patterns from these datasets and creating mathematical models to fit patterns and minimize errors. The group aims to build ML models to predict the physiological effects of spaceflight hazards using multi-modal biological and environmental data. Focus areas include causal inference, foundation models, and "self-driving" labs. Causal inference aims to elucidate causal relationships in complex biological data by combining invariance theory and ML methodology. Foundation models are trained on large, broad datasets and then refined on smaller datasets, which is relevant to space biology research due to limited sample size and restricted problem space. Self-driving labs are cutting-edge technology designed for space exploration. They employ automation and cloud-based systems to collect data points in a consistent and reproducible manner, leading to enhanced data acquisition and analysis.
