# OSDR Introduction

### Introduction to NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) <a href="#brcyrnoxf6tk" id="brcyrnoxf6tk"></a>

The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) is an open-access data collection from spaceflight-related missions and other related research activities. The purpose of the OSDR is to provide a centralized location for researchers to access and share data, promote collaboration and discovery, and accelerate scientific research. The OSDR contains various data types, including genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolic and imaging data. The data is available for download in multiple formats, including CSV, JSON, and XML. The OSDR is a valuable resource for researchers studying topics related to space biology including both human health and environmental science. This training provides an overview of the OSDR and how to access and use the data. The data repository is organized by experiment. Each experiment has a distinct page with a description of the experiment, the data files, and the associated publications.

In addition to providing access to data, the OSDR also offers a variety of tools and resources to help researchers use the data. These tools include a data search engine, a data visualization tool, and a data analysis tool. The OSDR also hosts a community forum where researchers can discuss the data and collaborate on projects. The NASA Open Science Data Repository is a powerful and continually evolving ecosystem of open science tools that is helping to advance scientific research and increase the accessibility of Space Biology data. Many users create new code to analyze data from the OSDR and share it with the global community through Git Hub and complete published data products through Zenodo. By providing access to a wealth of open-access data, the OSDR is accelerating the pace of discovery and helping to make the world a better place.

It includes journal articles, reports, and other scientific documents that have been made publicly available.

**AI/ML:** The "AI/ML" drop-down menu offers a link to the "AI4LS" (Artificial Intelligence for Life in Space Working Group) page. This working group brings together experts from NASA, academia, and industry to explore the potential of AI and machine learning for advancing life in space.

[**AI4LS:**](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/data/ai4ls.html) The AI4LS working group focuses on utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods to analyze complex, heterogeneous, multi-modal biological datasets. ML approaches have shown promise for deriving meaningful patterns from these datasets and creating mathematical models to fit patterns and minimize errors. The group aims to build ML models to predict the physiological effects of spaceflight hazards using multi-modal biological and environmental data. Focus areas include causal inference, foundation models, and "self-driving" labs. Causal inference aims to elucidate causal relationships in complex biological data by combining invariance theory and ML methodology. Foundation models are trained on large, broad datasets and then refined on smaller datasets, which is relevant to space biology research due to limited sample size and restricted problem space. Self-driving labs are cutting-edge technology designed for space exploration. They employ automation and cloud-based systems to collect data points in a consistent and reproducible manner, leading to enhanced data acquisition and analysis.

#### **Seminars:** The analysis working groups regularly host spacebiology discussions and seminars. <a href="#gibzvugs02ne" id="gibzvugs02ne"></a>
